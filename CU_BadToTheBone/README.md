# CU BadToTheBone

This is the official algorithm collection for team CU BadToTheBone. It consists of 25 page copy-pastable C++ code which we can carry for many onsite contests. See [notebook.pdf](https://github.com/ludehsar/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/CU_BadToTheBone/notebook.pdf) for the final version, and [content](https://github.com/ludehsar/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/CU_BadToTheBone/content) for raw source code.

## Contribution

Here, we will be submitting the codes in hpp format (so that we can include other codes if necessary without reimplementing it). Code should be clean, short and fast enough and the codes should pass the unit testing. Each code must include the [template code](). We should try to modularize every code for easy understanding of their functionality.

## Folder Structure

We will arrange the code according to the following folder structure:

1. adhoc
    * josephus
2. combinatorics
3. data-tructure
    * fenwick-tree
    * ordered-set
    * segment-tree
    * sparse-table
4. dynamic-programming
5. fft
6. flow
7. geometry
    * half-planner
8. graph
    * dijkstra
    * hld
    * lca
9. math
10. number-theory
11. numerical
    * interpolation
12. string
    * aho-corasick
    * double-hashing
    * kmp
    * suffix-array
